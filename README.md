DSA-LeetCode-Solutions
This repository is a personal project by Ankita Mandal to document my daily practice with data structures and algorithms (DSA) by solving problems on LeetCode. Each commit represents a new problem tackled, with solutions primarily implemented in cpp/java.

Project Goals
The main objectives of this repository are to:

Build a Consistent Habit: Regularly solve problems to reinforce my understanding of fundamental DSA concepts.

Create a Learning Log: Maintain a structured and organized record of my solutions and the different approaches I explore.

Track Progress: Visually track my journey and improvement in problem-solving over time.

Showcase Skills: Serve as a public portfolio demonstrating my coding abilities and dedication to continuous learning.

Repository Structure
Solutions are organized to be easy to navigate. I plan to use the following structure:

├── [Topic_Name_1]
│   ├── [Problem_Name_1]/
│   │   └── solution.cpp
│   ├── [Problem_Name_2]/
│   │   └── solution.cpp
│   └── ...
├── [Topic_Name_2]
│   └── ...
└── README.md

Each solution folder will contain the code, along with comments explaining the logic, time complexity, and space complexity.

How to Use
If you're interested in my journey, feel free to explore the solutions and provide any constructive feedback.

Thank you for visiting!
